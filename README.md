# Data_Transformation_Pipeline_-ACW-

## Project Outline

I built this project to design and implement an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that transforms a large, unstructured CSV dataset into a structured, feature-rich, and analytics-ready format — the kind of foundational work that underpins real-world data science, analytics, and machine learning projects.

The workflow replicates the early-stage data engineering tasks performed by professional teams: ingesting raw user data, restructuring it into nested formats, grouping and aggregating similar categories, and engineering new columns to enrich the dataset. The result is a clean, well-organised dataset ready for downstream analytics, business intelligence, or predictive modelling.

##  Key Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- **Data Acquisition & Ingestion:** Loading large raw datasets from CSV into a manageable Python environment
- **Data Wrangling & Transformation:** Regrouping user attributes (e.g., employment status, pension, retirement), restructuring data into nested formats, and reshaping complex tables  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, meaningful columns to enhance analytical and predictive value
- **Scalable Pipeline Design:** Demonstrating best practices in building reproducible preprocessing workflows for production-scale analytics projects 
- **Preparation for Downstream Tasks:** Delivering structured, analytics-ready data suitable for dashboards, BI reporting, and machine-learning model training

##  Why This Project Matters

In real-world data science and AI teams, 80% of project time is often spent preparing data — cleaning, restructuring, and transforming it into a usable state. This project demonstrates that critical skillset.

By designing a pipeline that ingests raw user data and delivers a structured, enriched, and analysis-ready dataset, I show my ability to bridge the gap between raw data collection and actionable insight generation — a capability central to roles in data engineering, data science, and analytics consulting.

This project reflects workflows commonly used in production environments across industries such as fintech, public sector analytics, customer insights, and business intelligence.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository (Git Bash was used):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-transformation-pipeline.git
cd data-transformation-pipeline
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate (For Windows)
source .venv/bin/activate (For macOS/Linux)
```

3. Create a txt folder in your file directory (requirements.txt)
paste the following in an ordinary list format without the bullet points in the txt file (requirements.txt)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Run this code line to install all requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Use your preferred notebook

   
5. Execute the notebook cells to run the complete data transformation pipeline.
